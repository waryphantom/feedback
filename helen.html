        “It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil. If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui.” ― Helen Keller<br><br><br> Helen Keller begins her
        autobiography by pointing out the difficulties of writing autobiography and the unreliability of memory. She says that this book will contain sketches of “the most interesting and important episodes” of her childhood and youth. She then gives
        a brief account of her family background. Her ancestors were Swiss, and her grandfather settled in Alabama, where Keller was born in the small town of Tuscumbia in 1880. In the second year of her life, she became seriously ill and was not expected
        to survive. When she did recover, she was both blind and deaf.
