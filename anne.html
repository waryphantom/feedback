        “I've found that there is always some beauty left -- in nature, sunshine, freedom, in yourself; these can all help you.” ― Anne Frank<br><br><br> Anne Frank's Diary is not a novel or a tale of the imagination. It is the diary kept by a young Jewish
        girl for the two years she was forced to remain in hiding by the Nazi persecution of the Jews of Europe. Between June 1942 and August 1944, from Anne's thirteenth birthday until shortly after her fifteenth birthday, Anne Frank recorded her feelings,
        her emotions, and her thoughts, as well as the events that happened to her, in the diary which her father had given her as a birthday present.
