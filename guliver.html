        “Undoubtedly, philosophers are in the right when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by comparison.” ― Jonathan Swift
        <br><br><br> Gulliver's Travels is an adventure story (in reality, a misadventure story) involving several voyages of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, who, because of a series of mishaps en route to recognized ports, ends up, instead, on several
        unknown islands living with people and animals of unusual sizes, behaviors, and philosophies, but who, after each adventure, is somehow able to return to his home in England where he recovers from these unusual experiences and then sets out again
        on a new voyage.
